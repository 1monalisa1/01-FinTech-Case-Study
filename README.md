## Origin & Overview
* *Klarna* ®
	* 2005 • Founded in Stockholm, Sweden

* *Founding Team*
	* Sebastian Siemiatkowski
	* Niklas Adalberth
	* Victor Jacobsson

* *The Idea*
	* Sebastian and Niklas were working at a Burger King, and later met Victor when studying for their undergraduate program at the Stockholm School of Economics.
	* Before studying for his masters, Sebastian missed registration due to being stuck abroad temporarily, and ended up working for a debt collection agency by happenstance that had been contracted by e-commerce stores to collect on past due invoices following the Dotcom crisis.
	* Sebastian came up with an idea to start a company that takes on the credit risk for the merchants that profits from transaction fees and presented the idea as a project at the Stockholm School of Economics, but had been told that it would never work (productmint.com).
	* The idea had been focused on the notion that people want to shop online and do not have the option to reputably ‘try before they buy’.  The founding team sought to develop a website that creates a seamless process for customers at checkout.
	* When presenting the idea, they decided to maintain a narrow scope and disrupt banking through FinTech.  Their approach continues to be to focus on the westernized global community and remain rooted in their niche rather than trying to be a bank that covers a wide scope.  Retail banks are focused on payments, lending and savings, and they choose to keep their scope narrow.
	* Payment companies and banks continue to make less revenue per transaction as they try to compete on price, so Klarna must compete in other ways in order to gain a greater share of the market while prices compress.  Their key differentiator is the ease of doing business provided through their app and the robust partnerships they have built with merchants and other payment processing companies (Slush Interview).

* *Funding*
	* Following rejection, the founding team met Jane Walerud, one of Sweden’s most successful angel investors, at a networking event (productmint.com).
		* Initial Funding:  60,000€ in seed funding for a 10% stake and 5 software developers for an additional 37% stake
	* Klarna has received $2.1B in additional funding from 40 different private equity firms, corporations and individual investors such as Sequoia Capital, HMI Capital, Blackrock, H&M, Visa and Snoop Dogg (Crunchbase & Dealroom).

* *Who Klarna Is*
	* Klarna provides a seamless client checkout experience by linking merchants, payment solutions, and their consumers through an app that focuses on ease of use, aesthetics, and smooth shipping / returns.
	* *Klarna Holding AB*, a Swedish public limited liability company,  has subsidiaries operating in 17 countries (Klarna).
	* They are a fully licensed bank in Europe, and operate differently in the US, Canada and Australia.  
	
* *Who Klarna Is Not*
	* A retail merchant
	* A bank that provides complex loans or first-party savings products to consumers
	* A US bank
	* A franchised business
	* A layaway service (not a pay over time, own later service)
* *Early 'Near Death Experience'* 
	* First Christmas:  When they were supposed to pay their merchants from their company bank accounts during the holiday shopping rush, they did not have the money.  They delayed their employees salaries to pay the merchants, and also asked merchants if they could be granted some grace in providing them with timely payment (Slush Interview).  They fortunately maintained trust and survived.

## Business Activities

* *Specific Financial Problems Klarna Solves*
	* The founders believed that the checkout, payment and return processes for retail businesses were difficult and fragmented, so they sought a solution to make these processes seamless and enjoyable for customers.  They initially focused on the idea that customers should have the option to try a product before providing payment to the retailer.   Klarna has leveraged key partnerships and financial technology to provide an exceptional customer experience to both the merchants and customers they serve.

* *Benefits to the Consumer*  
	* Simplicity, ease of use, access to premium retailers, greater trust in new online retailers, and easy shipping & returns (Klarna)

* *Benefits to the Merchant*
	* Merchant does not bear the credit risk,  payments are received within 3 days of the point-of-sale, increase in order size, increase in repeat business,  online retailers gain consumer trust, and the payment / delivery / return customer experience is outsourced
	* Their merchants are willing to pay Klarna a premium versus what they are willing to pay other merchant service companies for payment processing because Klarna drives customers to their businesses through their app, and also enhances the overall customer experience throughout the checkout process which drives greater brand loyalty (CNBC Interview).

* *Over 200,000 Merchants • Including:*
	* Sephora • Groupon • SHEIN • Nixon • Charlotte Tilbury • Vans • The North Face • Ted Baker • Timberland • 
Ralph Lauren • Club Monaco • Anine Bing • Domino’s Pizza • NTWRK • Finish Line • Aéropostale •
Nautica • Fender • ASOS • H&M • Gymshark • IKEA • Farfetch • Cult Beauty • Dyson • JD Sports • Acne
Studios • Peloton • Bose • Missguided • Samsung • Sonos • Beauty Bay, AliExpress • Abercrombie
& Fitch, Lenovo • Overstock • Michael Kors
* *Merchant Integration*
	* On the merchants' websites and mobile apps, the customer encounters Klarna through the following touchpoints:
		* While Shopping
			* Home / Landing Page:  Top strip banners introduce Klarna.
			* Search / Category Page:  Personalized payment promotions are integrated on the search page.
			* Product Page:  Show personalized payment promotions with each product.
			* Card Page:  Cart placements show the promotional price for the entire cart.
			* Checkout Page:  Payment selector & checkout widget explain Klarna in simple terms during a one-click checkout.
			* Pre-qualification Banners:  Help customers know how likely they are to receive credit.
			* Instant Shopping Buttons:  Offer express checkout that let customers buy quickly anywhere (Klarna Handbook).
		* Post-Purchase
			* Merchant Email:  Confirmation emails that include Klarna payment information in your customer send-outs.
			* Klarna App / Klarna.com:  Receipt images to improve clarity and reduce contact rates post-purchase
			* Shipping Details:  Send shipping details so customers know what is happening to their package.
			* In-app Shopping:  Configure your brand for shopping with Klarna

* *Financial Arrangements Offered by Klarna*
	* Pay in-full within a specified period following checkout by entering a major credit card or bank information
		*  Credit card and bank information may be entered following checkout, so that the customer does not need to provide private information when shopping in a public setting such as on a bus or train.
	* 3 ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) options:
		* 3 or 4 equal installments 
		* 3 to 36 month financing available for larger purchases
		* Pay in-full within 30 days (Klarna)
			* Klarna allows customers “to skip paying for an item upfront, and just entering an e-mail and delivery addresses. Klarna analyzes a person’s online credit history and browsing behavior to determine if they are creditworthy (Forbes).”
			* Klarna uses the customer’s address and email address to run a soft credit check paired with their Klarna shopping history and cell phone location data to assess risk when determining if they are eligible for BNPL on the transaction (Finder.com).
			
* *Leveraging Technology*
	* Klarna Shopping App: Available on iOS & Android
		* According to Klarna's website, their app has had:
			* 1.3 million app downloads globally (IOS + Android) in May – an all time high. This means on average of close to 			42,000 downloads per day.
			* More than 16 million downloads in total.
			* In Q1 2020, Klarna’s app saw almost 300,000 more downloads than our direct competitor in the US.
			* The app had over 11 million monthly active users globally in April (82% growth year on year).
			4.7/5 rating in US App Store.
			* Top-ranked among shopping apps in all markets where it’s available.
			* More than 2.7 million items to their wish lists since the feature became available in 2019.
	* SecuriCAD:  Fully automated security assessments of their cloud architectures for risk assessment
		* As stated by Klarna's CSO:
			* "Manually modelling an environment of our scale for simulation is simply not feasible not with a high level of detail. While simulation is probably one of the few ways to risk assess a large-scale environment in continuous change, the key is to build the model continuously based on the real environment. We see this as a leap, moving away from human subjective assessment and the rigidity of formal strict security frameworks and keeping consistent security. While frameworks and human assessment will absolutely be a part in our work for the foreseeable future, we also have to find new ways to keep our security posture on top and keep a high speed of innovation.

			  "Through automated modelling of our environment, we see a potential to significantly increase development speed, and take on the challenge of looking at the whole while having clear control of all the details and moving pieces.

			  "The simulation capability increases both our capability to see how changes in one team’s environment can affect others and to make assessments more consistent. In the end, it increases security where it really counts" (Foreseeti).
	* AWS:  Amazon Web Services became Klarna's preferred cloud provider.
		* According to Amazon's press release on December 2, 2019:
			* "As a fully licensed bank, Klarna works closely with AWS’s compliance and security assurance teams to help it maintain the necessary trusted infrastructure to the highest security standards and has built its core banking platform on AWS from the ground up. To complement this, Klarna has developed a microservices architecture on AWS that will optimize costs by using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service" (Business Wire).
			* "Klarna plans to follow up the successful launches of its cloud-based Open Banking Platform and Customer Authentication Platform with additional on-demand products using AWS. “Open Banking by Klarna” provides online merchants and eCommerce providers with the ability to leverage Klarna’s secure, reliable, and compliant banking infrastructure to develop their own payment facilities. It also opens up the ability for these online providers to connect with Klarna’s network of over 4,300 financial institutions around the world to better serve their customers. The Customer Authentication Platform allows multinational businesses to provide a simple, secure, and personalized customer authentication experience in any market through a one-time integration" (Business Wire) 
			* "Klarna is also planning to use AWS’s ML services, such as Amazon SageMaker, to help merchants train and build ML models to better identify and manage risk, predicting credit scores in real time, forecasting long-term economic trends, and helping end users to better manage payments and other transactions" (Business Wire).

* *Trends and Expansion within Consumer Payments and Credit Services*
	* Large companies such as Apple and Google have added payment processing features for their customers.  
	* PayPal and Venmo continue to also expand within the consumer payment processing and credit space.
	* Large banks such as JPMorgan Chase's Paymentech have begun enhancing their merchant services software and customer facing applications by leveraging new developments within the FinTech community.
	* Klarna intends to continue expanding their market share by providing an exceptionally *‘smoooth’* customer experience around the checkout and return processes on their app.

* *Main Competitors*
	* PayPal Credit:  Klarna’s new focus on ‘buy now, pay later' is in direct competition with PayPal ’s financing business, PayPal Credit (Forbes).  PayPal also has a large share of the market from its tenure in the payment processing space.
		* Klarna’s checkout process is more user friendly and involves less steps than PayPal Credit.
	* Afterpay (Australia): Similar business model currently with less market share.
	* Affirm (US): Similar business model with less market share, but also has emergency retailers such as car repair shops on their platform.
	* Store Credit Cards / Major Credit Cards:  
		* Gen-Z and Millennial consumers are using credit cards less than older generations, and have shown a preference for financing that does not impact their credit report with specified payment terms at the time of purchase rather than the ambiguity of open-ended lines of credit.

* *Competitors with Whom Klarna Chooses Not to Proactively Compete* 
	* Who:  Google, ApplePay, large banks with large scopes, Chinese and Japanese payment processing companies
	* Why:  They believe that focusing on their niche market in western countries will help them win the greatest market share in the markets they serve through providing an exceptional customer experience (Slush Interview).

* *How Does Klarna Make Money?*
	* Merchants are charged a transaction fee.
		* Posted Rate:  From 0.30 USD + 3.29% per transaction (Klarna)
	* Customers are not charged late fees or transaction fees.
		* Customers are charged interest only in certain markets like the US.

* *Risks to Profitability*
	* Fraud and credit losses
	* Underestimating their competitors in the broader marketplace
	* Eastern creativity, efficiency and work ethic expanding their companies from China and Japan to western markets (Slush Interview)
	* Future FinTech disrupters entering the market that challenge or improve upon Klarna’s business model

* *Market Differences Across Borders* 
 	* Why different services are offered in the countries they serve:
		* Consumer behavior is different in each country, so the product must iterate to meet the needs and trends of each market.
		* Bank regulators in different countries have different requirements (Slush Interview).	

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations
* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?*
	* Expand to the clothing resale market and high-end clothing rental market through B2C channels.
		* Continuing to leverage B2C models has proven effective for Klarna, so if Klarna continues to focus on the payment and client experience parts of the process rather than becoming a C2C middleman, this would make for an easy transition since revenue within the current business model is primarily generated from the merchants remitting a portion of the gross transactions to Klarna.
		* Marketing Campaign: *"Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Oh so Smoooth"*
		* Benefits:  More transactions / more revenue.  Expanding consumer base while leveraging current technology.
	* Incorporate visual search AI technology in current search tools.
		* If you see something you like when you are out and about in the real world or browsing Instagram from your desk, what if Klarna could locate the exact item or similar items through the merchants they have on their platform?  This could also be used as a prospecting tool, for if an item did not return an exact match, but a match could be found elsewhere, Klarna could use this information to pitch prospective merchants.  Consumers could also use this technology to compare pricing and quality of similar items when making buying decisions.
		* Benefits:  Instant gratification, increase impulse purchasing, customer spends little to no time searching for what they are looking for, fun technology could increase wallet share and draw attention to Klarna's offering 
	* Assess whether or not to pursue creating a financial education program for consumers. This would require the development of a mobile financial education platform or partnership with a current provider in FinTech.
		* Does this align or conflict with the business’ priorities and values?
		* Would providing education around responsible credit use help or hurt sales revenues?
		* Is this something to offer to all of users or for customers that are seeking to repair credit to eventually access financing options through Klarna?
		* Could participation in financial education help users ‘earn’ access to credit?
		* Benefits:  Feeling good about the product/service they offer, improving the spending habits of Millennials and Gen-Z, goodwill of the communities they operate within, and good press which all could also ultimately lead to broadening their market share. 
	* Has Klarna considered partnering with government agencies or the United Nations around responsible credit use initiatives?
		* Benefits: The data Klarna has accumulated over time likely has quantifiable monetary value, and may also aid organizations in understanding the consumer spending habits and fluid attitudes toward credit in the communities they serve.  Big data, AI and machine learning could be utilized for this project.
