## Overview and Origin
* *Klarna* ®
	* 2005 • Founded in Stockholm, Sweden

* *Founding Team*
	* Sebastian Siemiatkowski
	* Niklas Adalberth
	* Victor Jacobsson

* *The Idea*
	* Sebastian and Niklas were working at a Burger King, and later met Victor when attending the Stockholm School of Economics.
	* Before studying for his masters, Sebastian missed registration due to being stuck abroad temporarily, and ended up working for a debt collection agency by happenstance that had been contracted by e-commerce stores to collect on past due invoices following the Dotcom crisis.
	* Sebastian came up with an idea to start a company that takes on the credit risk for the merchants that profits from transaction fees, and presented the idea as a project at the Stockholm School of Economics, but had been told that it would never work (productmint.com).
	* The idea had been focused on the notion that people want to shop online and do not have the option to reputably ‘try before they buy’.  The founding team sought to develop a website that creates a seamless process for customers at checkout.
	* When presenting the idea, they decided to maintain a narrow scope and disrupt banking through FinTech.  Their approach continues to be to focus on the westernized global community and remain rooted in their niche rather than trying to be a bank that covers a wide scope.  Retail banks are focused on payments, lending and savings, and they choose to keep their scope narrow.
	* Payment companies and banks continue to make less per transaction as they try to compete on price, so Klarna must compete in other ways in order to gain a greater share of the market while prices compress.  Their key differentiator is the ease of doing business provided through their app and the robust partnerships they have built with merchants and other payment processing companies (Slush Interview).

* *Funding*
	* Following rejection, the founding team met Jane Walerud, one of Sweden’s most successful angel investors, at a networking event (productmint.com).
		* Initial Funding:  60,000€ in seed funding for a 10% stake and 5 software developers for an additional 37% stake
	* Klarna has received $2.1B in additional funding from 40 different private equity firms, corporations and individual investors such as Sequoia Capital, HMI Capital, Blackrock, H&M, Visa and Snoop Dogg (Crunchbase & Dealroom).

* *Early 'Near Death Experience'* 
	* First Christmas:  When they were supposed to pay their merchants from their company bank accounts during the holiday shopping rush, they did not have the money.  They delayed their employees salaries to pay the merchants, and also asked merchants if they could be granted some grace in providing them with timely payment (Slush Interview).  They fortunately maintained trust and survived.

## Business Activities:
* *Who Klarna Is*
	* Klarna provides a seamless client checkout experience by linking merchants, payment solutions, and their consumers through an app that focuses on ease of use, aesthetics, and smooth shipping / returns.
	* They are a fully licensed bank in Europe,  and operate differently in the US.  
	* *Klarna Holding AB*, a Swedish public limited liability company,  has subsidiaries operating in 17 countries (Klarna).
	
* *Who Klarna Is Not*
	* A retail merchant
	* A bank that provides complex loans or savings products to consumers
	* A US bank
	* A franchised business

* *Specific Financial Problems Klarna Solves*
	* The founders believed that the checkout, payment and return processes for retail businesses were difficult and fragmented, so they sought a solutions to make these processes seamless and enjoyable for customers.  They initially focused on the idea that customers should have the option to try a product before providing payment to the retailer.   Klarna has leveraged key partnerships and financial technology to provide an exceptional customer experience to both the merchants and customers they serve.
	
* *Benefits to the Consumer*  
	* Simplicity, ease of use, access to premium retailers, greater trust in new online retailers, and easy shipping / returns
	
* *Benefits to the Merchant*
	* Merchant does not bear the credit risk,  payments are received within 3 days of the point-of-sale, increase in order size, increase in repeat business,  online retailers gain consumer trust, and the payment / delivery / return customer experience is outsourced
	* Merchants are willing to pay Klarna a premium versus what they are willing to pay credit card companies, for Klarna drives customers to their businesses through their app, and also enhances the overall customer experience throughout the checkout process which drives greater brand loyalty (CNBC Interview).

* *Financial Arrangements Offered by Klarna*
	* Pay in-full within a specified period following checkout by entering a major credit card or bank information
		*  Credit card and bank information may be entered following checkout, so that the customer does not need to provide private information when shopping in a public setting such as on a bus or train.
	* 3 ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) options:
			* 3 or 4 equal installments 
			* 3-36 month financing available for larger purchases
			* Pay in-full within 30 days (Klarna)
		* Klarna allows customers “to skip paying for an item upfront, and just entering an e-mail and delivery addresses. Klarna analyzes a person’s online credit history and browsing behavior to determine if they are creditworthy (Forbes).”
		* Klarna uses the customer’s address and information to run a soft credit check paired with their Klarna history to determine if they are eligible for BNPL on the transaction (finder.com)
			

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

* Key Partnerships**
**	* 
* Types of Merchants**

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

* *Main Competitors*
	* PayPal Credit:  Klarna’s focus on ‘buy now, pay later’ (BNPL) is in direct competition with PayPal ’s financing business, PayPal Credit (Forbes).
		* Klarna’s checkout process is more user friendly and involves less steps than PayPal Credit.
	* Store Credit Cards / Major Credit Cards:  
		* Millennials are using credit cards less than older generations, and have shown a preference for financing that does not impact their credit report with specified payment terms at the time of purchase rather than the ambiguity of open-ended lines of credit.

* *Competitors With Whom Klarna Chooses Not to Proactively Compete* 
	 * Who:  Google, ApplePay, large banks with large scopes, Chinese and Japanese payment processing companies
	* Why:  They believe that focusing on their niche market in western countries will help them win the greatest market share in the markets they serve through providing an exceptional customer experience (Slush Interview).

* *How Does Klarna Make Money?*

		* Posted Rate:  From 0.30 USD + 3.29% per transaction (Klarna)
	* 	Customers are not charged late fees or transaction fees.
		* Customers are charged interest only in certain markets like the US.

* *Risks to Profitability*
	* Fraud and credit losses
	* Underestimating their competitors in the broader marketplace

*Market Differences Across Borders* 
 	* Consumer behavior is different in each country, so the product must  iterate to meet the needs and trends of each market.
	* Bank regulators in different countries have different requirements (Slush Interview).
	

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations
* *If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?*
	* Expand to the clothing resale market and high-end clothing rental market through B2C channels.
		* Continuing to leverage B2C models has proven effective for Klarna, so if Klarna continues to focus on the payment and client experience parts of the process rather than becoming a C2C middleman, this would make for an easy transition since revenue within the current business model is primarily generated from the merchants remitting a portion of the gross transactions to Klarna.
	* Assess if whether or not to pursue developing financial education:
		* Does this align or conflict with the business’ priorities and values?
		* Would providing education around responsible credit use help or hurt sales revenues?
		* Is this something to offer to all of users or for customers that are seeking to repair credit to eventually access financing options through Klarna?
		* Could participation in financial education help users ‘earn’ access to credit?
	* Has Klarna considered partnering with government agencies or the United Nations around responsible credit use initiatives?

* *Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
	* Clothing Resale / Cloth Rental Markets:  More transactions, more revenue.  
	* Financial Education:  Feeling good about the product/service they offer, improving the spending habits of millenials, goodwill of the communities they operate within, and good press which all could also ultimately lead to broadening their marketshare. 
	* Partnerships with Government Agencies / United Nations:  The data Klarna has accumulated over time may have monetary value, and may also aid organizations in understanding the consumer spending habits and fluid attitudes toward credit in the communities they serve.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
